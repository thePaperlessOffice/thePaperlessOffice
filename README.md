- 👋 Hi, I’m George 'Sir' Goddard, Manager/Owner of The Paperless Office (1997), Chief Tutor/Assessor of the College of Virtual Sciences. (That's what my students call me).
- 👀 I’m interested in contributing to the GitHub Global community.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Internet Technology at the COSTAATT, Trinidad. My experience/training dates back to 1986 with the IBM XT/ATs, MS-DOS, DBase, Word and Lotus 123. 
Love Access, need to  get hands on experience in SQL. Worked with Caribbean telephone companies. Developed a regional intranet (1992) using Second Sight. Worked with Macs.
Empowered by Systems Analysis and Design but yet to develop "my first app" and officially launch the TPO/CVS website later this year, in celebration of 25 years as a
micro entrepreneur. Can boast of being the first SOHO.
New to Linux. Gaining some experience on Android Studio and exploring the feasibility of using Wordpress as oppose to writing code from scratch.
- 💞️ Been working with youth since the 80s. I’m looking to collaborate on specific TVET programmes in the Post COVID CALA region. Currently working on a 2 week pilot for our
planned The New YEW (Youth Entrepreneurship Webinar) series. Any assistance/contribution(s), will be more than welcomed. The global pandemic warrants "all hands on deck" i.e.
Git Hub.
- 📫 I can be reached @ 1 (868) 716 1601 or via email: gtggoddard@gmail.com.
